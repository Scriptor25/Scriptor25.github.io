## Welcome

Hello, I would like to introduce myself: My name is Felix Schreiber, I'm 18 years old and a (hobby) programmer living in Germany. Most of my projects consist of pure interest in the subject matter: e.g. I have developed several interpreted/compiled programming languages (ChainSaw), tried to create my own operating system (which didn't really work out), and worked on some ROS/ROS2 projects. I'm also an, almost experienced, graphics programmer who has worked with OpenGL, glsl, a bit of Vulkan, and I've been immersed in raytracing/pathtracing techniques for several years. I have experience in C, C++ and Java, and, this is VERY important: I HATE PYTHON. I do all this in my spare time, but if you want to use my work or work with me on a project, just contact me via Discord or EMail, I'm looking forward to an exciting project!
