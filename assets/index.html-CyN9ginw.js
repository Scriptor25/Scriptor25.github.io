Most of my projects consist of pure interest in the subject matter: e.g. I have developed several interpreted/compiled programming languages (ChainSaw), tried to create my own operating system (which didn&#39;t really work out), and worked on some ROS/ROS2 projects. I&#39;m also an, almost experienced, graphics programmer who has worked with OpenGL, glsl, a bit of Vulkan, and I&#39;ve been immersed in raytracing/pathtracing techniques for several years. I have experience in C, C++ and Java, and, this is VERY important: I HATE PYTHON. I do all this in my spare time, but if you want to use my work or work with me on a project, just contact me via Discord or EMail, I&#39;m looking forward to an exciting project!</p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt="Scriptor25 Logo"></p><h2 id="this-website" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#this-website"><span>This Website</span></a></h2><p>This site is made using VuePress, a framework built upon VueJs.</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="VuePress Logo"></p>',7),l=[n];function c(m,h){return t(),i("div",null,l)}const g=e(s,[["render",c],["__file","index.html.vue"]]),u=JSON.parse('{"path":"/","title":"Home","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"date":"2024-04-14T00:00:00.000Z"},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Welcome","slug":"welcome","link":"#welcome","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"This Website","slug":"this-website","link":"#this-website","children":[]}],"git":{"createdTime":1713121949000,"updatedTime":1713126277000,"contributors":[{"name":"Felix Schreiber","email":"83061405+Scriptor25@users.noreply.github.com","commits":1}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":0.57,"words":172},"filePathRelative":"index.md","localizedDate":"April 14, 2024"}');export{g as comp,u as data};
